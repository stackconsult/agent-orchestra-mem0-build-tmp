# OpenMemory Integration Guide

## Project Overview

This is the **Agent Orchestra with 6-Layer Context Engineering** - a production-grade AI orchestration platform that automatically understands user needs, domain context, and operational constraints.

## User Defined Namespaces

- `context_engineering` - Core framework implementation and architecture
- `orchestration` - Context-aware routing and agent coordination  
- `security_compliance` - Two-wall compliance system and security framework
- `api_integration` - Enhanced APIs and integration patterns
- `testing_deployment` - Testing infrastructure and deployment patterns
- `competitive_advantage` - StackConsulting differentiation and market positioning

## Key Capabilities

### 6-Layer Context Engineering

- User Layer: Identity, expertise, preferences, history
- Intent Layer: Job detection with 95%+ accuracy
- Domain Layer: Repository analysis and entity relationships
- Rules Layer: Hard walls (compliance) + soft walls (style)
- Environment Layer: System state and deployment context
- Exposition Layer: Optimized LLM payload synthesis

### Production Features

- Context-aware model routing
- Automatic compliance enforcement
- Semantic caching with intent awareness
- Token budget optimization
- Comprehensive monitoring and debugging

## Memory Usage

This system uses OpenMemory to:

- Store implementation patterns and architectural decisions
- Track component relationships and integration points
- Maintain compliance and security requirements
- Document competitive advantages and differentiators
- Preserve testing and deployment best practices

## Integration Status

✅ Context engineering framework fully implemented
✅ All 6 layers operational with production optimization
✅ Compliance and security framework active
✅ Enhanced APIs with context metadata
✅ Comprehensive test suite passing
✅ Documentation complete and migration-ready

## Next Steps

- Deploy to production environments
- Monitor context engineering performance
- Collect user feedback on personalization
- Optimize token usage and cache effectiveness
- Expand domain-specific context sources
